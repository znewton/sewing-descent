        <p>
            In a dying world where petroleum dependency and short-lived products
            feel unavoidable, our core principles revolve entirely around
            sustainability:
            <a href="#refuse">Refuse</a>, <a href="#repair">Repair</a>,
            <a href="#repurpose">Repurpose</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="refuse">Refuse</h3>
        <p>
            Refuse to use petroleum products without good reason.
            <a href="#petroleum-products">Petroleum products</a> have a great
            many benefits over renewable alternatives, but those benefits often
            pale in comparison to

        <p>
            Repair gear when it breaks, and design gear to be repairable in the
            first place. This can be as small as replacing a sewn-in piece of
            elastic webbing with a tied-in piece of shock cord or as large as
            re-waterproofing an entire bag.

        <h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
        <p>
            Our goal is to use avoid petroleum-based materials wherever
            possible. Primarily, we use
            <a href="#waxed-canvas">waxed canvas</a> for external shell fabric,
            and <a href="factory-scraps">factory scraps</a> when thin,
            lightweight plastic is preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, sometimes materials that break down quickly can drastically
            reduce the durability or longevity of a product. Also, this is just
            a <i>small, hobby</i> project, so petroleum alternatives can be cost
            prohibitive or entirely unavailable. In these cases,
            <strong>minimal but intentional</strong> use of
            <a href="petroleum-products">petroleum products</a> is required.

                &ldquo;A common definition of 'ultralight' is: hiking with the
                lightest pack weight possible by taking a minimal amount of the
                lightest gear required to be safe for a given trip.&rdquo;<br />

        <p>
            We don't claim to make <i>the most minimal</i> gear, but we do limit
            the amount of ultra-specific features in our gear, which aligns with
            the ultralight ethos of <strong>minimalism</strong> and
            <strong>multi-functionality</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            That means making gear that can serve multiple purposes well with
            little-to-no bells & whistles, rather than one purpose perfectly.
        </p>
        <h3>Ultralight Design in Practice</h3>
        <p>
            In practice, our design process can look like the following example:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <strong>Need:</strong><br />A small/medium volume backpack
                that's good for day hikes, overnight backpacking, and even light
                ski touring.

        <p>
            This design philosophy means that we won't be the lightest gear on
            the market, but you'll have functionally light gear with options to
            add/remove any features for the day.
