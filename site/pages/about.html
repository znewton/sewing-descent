        <p>
            Sewing Descent is a hobby project created by Zach Newton to make
            outdoor gear that combines
            <a href="#principles">eco-friendly principles</a>,
            <a href="#design">multi-functional design</a>, and
            <a href="#materials">sustainable materials</a>. We're based in
            Seattle, WA where "outside" and "rain" are frequently synonymous;
            you'll find that the need for water-resistance in a humid
            environment is a core driver in most of our projects.

        <p>
            In a dying world where petroleum dependency and short-lived products
            feel unavoidable, our core principles revolve entirely around
            sustainability:

            <a href="#repurpose">Repurpose</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="refuse">Refuse</h3>
        <p>
            Refuse to use petroleum products without good reason.
            <a href="#petroleum-products">Petroleum products</a> have a great

        <h3 id="repair">Repair</h3>
        <p>
            Repair gear when it breaks, and design gear to be repairable in the
            first place. This can be as small as replacing a sewn-in piece of
            elastic webbing with a tied-in piece of shock cord or as large as
            re-waterproofing an entire bag.
        </p>
        <h3 id="repurpose">Repurpose</h3>
        <p>
            Repurpose something we already have, rather than buy something new.

            That means repurposing &ldquo;trash&rdquo; such as using fabric from

            and cut plastic take-out containers as stiffeners.

            we can such as publishing our Waxed Canvas process and ingredients,
            our material suppliers, any digitized patterns, and whatever else
            people want to know. Hopefully, by sharing our knowledge and
            learnings, we can help others enter the sustainable gear making

        <p>
            Our goal is to use avoid buying and using fresh petroleum-based
            materials wherever possible. Primarily, we use
            <a href="#waxed-canvas">waxed canvas</a> for external shell fabric
            and <a href="factory-scraps">factory scraps</a> when thin,
            lightweight plastic is preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, sometimes materials that break down quickly can drastically
            reduce the durability or longevity of a product. Also, this is just
            a <i>small, hobby</i> project, so petroleum alternatives can be cost
            prohibitive or entirely unavailable. In these cases,
            <strong>minimal but intentional</strong> use of
            <a href="petroleum-products">petroleum products</a> is required.
        </p>
        <h3 id="waxed-canvas">Waxed Canvas</h3>
        <p>
            A fascination with the possibilities of waxed canvas was really what
            started this whole endeavor. In our experience, "breathable and
            waterproof" is <strong>never true</strong>, and once Zach learned
            that
            <a
                href="https://verber.com/stash/breathability.pdf"

                >waterproof breathability severely declines with increase in
                humidity</a
            >, waxed canvas became a fixation.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few crucial attributes to know about when talking waxed
            canvas:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Wax Composition:</strong> Most brands use</li>

            Big brands using petroleum products aren't going anywhere, and let's
            face it, petroleum-based materials
            <i>can be really, really cool</i>. Thankfully, some companies let
            you buy their factory scraps (leftovers from discontinued products
            or colors), often super cheap!

                &ldquo;A common definition of 'ultralight' is: hiking with the
                lightest pack weight possible by taking a minimal amount of the
                lightest gear required to be safe for a given trip.&rdquo;<br />

        </blockquote>
        <p>
            We don't claim to make <i>the most minimal</i> gear, but we do limit
            the amount of ultra-specific features in our gear, which aligns with
            the ultralight ethos of <strong>minimalism</strong> and
            <strong>multi-functionality</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            That means making gear that can serve multiple purposes well with
            little-to-no bells & whistles, rather than one purpose perfectly.
        </p>
        <h3>Ultralight Design in Practice</h3>
        <p>
            In practice, our design process can look like the following example:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <strong>Need:</strong><br />A small/medium volume backpack

                ski touring.

            </p>

        <p>
            This design philosophy means that we won't be the lightest gear on
            the market, but you'll have functionally light gear with options to
            add/remove any features for the day.
