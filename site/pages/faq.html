            My waxed canvas gear got dirty. How do I clean it?
        </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Don't throw it in wash!</strong> High temps and detergent
            will ruin the wax coating, and you'll have to fully re-wax it.
        </p>
        <p>
            To properly clean your waxed canvas gear, in increasing order of
            grime stubbornness:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wipe dirt away with a dry towel or natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li>Hose it down or wipe with a wet towel.</li>
            <li>
                Spot-clean a particularly dirty area with isopropyl alcohol.
                This might require re-waxing the cleaned spot.
            </li>
        </ol>

            My waxed canvas gear is starting to let water through. What do I do?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is the best part of waxed canvas gear:
            <strong>you get to rewax it!</strong>

        <p>
            One day, we hope to start selling our own blend of all-natural waxed
            canvas, and even include a small puck with each piece of gear. Until
            then, here are some brands we recommend. We know they're expensive,
            but they use high quality, plant-based ingredients just like us!

            in our recipe quite yet to say, "do this, it's perfect," but as soon

            "Sewing Descent?" That doesn't make sense... What does the name
            mean?
        </h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
            "Sewing Descent" is a bit of fun wordplay on the phrase "sow
            dissent."
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0">&ldquo;Sow Dissent&rdquo;</h4>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">
                To attempt to cause disagreement by subtle means.
                <br />&mdash;
                <a

        <p style="margin-top: 0">
            "Sow[ing]" is replaced by "Sewing" because that's what we do: we sew
            gear! "Dissent" is replaced by "Descent", alluding to the rewarding
            activity of descending mountains (whether hiking, biking, skiing,
            etc.). Lastly, we chose the phrase "Sowing Dissent" because we are
            "attempting to cause disagreement [with capitalism and consumerism]
            by subtle means!"
